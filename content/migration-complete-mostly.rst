Well, that's always a good reason to let out a sigh of relief: I've
managed to migrate most of the content from my previous blog over at
Wikidot (which wasn't really a blog so much as it was a hacked wiki). 
So, you'll find a lot more content here than before, which is good,
because it makes me look like I'm actually dedicated to creating content
;-)

I've also relaxed restrictions on comments (and added CAPTCHA security)
so comment away people, if you're reading this.  Just don't expect much
love if you spam though...
