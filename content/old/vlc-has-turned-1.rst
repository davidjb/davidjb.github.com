I may well be late to the party and a little late to celebrate, but I've
just made the startling discovery that VLC 1.0.0 has now been released.

I've been using VLC since (before, actually) I thought there had to more
to playing videos than needing extravagent codec packs like K-lite or
anything similar to be installed on your system.  It's been that long
that the first version I used, if I remember correctly, wasn't actually
being specifically used for client-side file playback and was supposed
to be geared towards video streaming over a network.  My memory may well
be wrong on that one, so don't quote me.

At any rate, VLC has matured in leaps and bounds across the versions,
much to the credit of all the developers working on it.  And this
version - above any others so far - is truly marvelous.  It's not too
often you see software that does everything you thought you needed - and
things you didn't.  I'll space you the mumbo-jumbo here, but if you
haven't seen it already, the change log is `here`_.

The features/updates I'd been waiting for were:

-  Fixing up DivX/XviD playback - and stopping me having to play/pause
   cycle a video to get it to play.
-  Global hotkeys - finally!  No more messing with GhostScript to get
   VLC to play if it's not in focus
-  Remembering past files and the location in the Open File dialog
-  Frame-by-frame playback - for finding those random stills in videos
-  Compressed file playback - seems like RAR files playback (and
   apparently Zip too)
-  Live recording - slicing out bits of videos with a single click
-  DVB playback for TV - looks good, haven't tested it yet though
-  Adjustable toolbars - yay!

The list goes on..but it ticks all the boxes.

Happy first birthday VLC; here's to version 2 and onwards.
