I've pretty much got a nice handle on Rewrite rules for Apache. Once
you've seen a few of them, it's straight forward enough to replicate for
new Plone sites and so forth.

However, to make things even easier on my brain I've found this:
`http://betabug.ch/zope/witch`_ , the Rewrite Rule Witch. Seems like the
rules it produces are what I'd expect, which makes me ponder why, if I
know they're right, would I bother.

**Reason:** easy confirmation and less chance of typos.
