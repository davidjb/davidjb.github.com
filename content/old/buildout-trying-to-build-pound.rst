So, trying to build ``pound`` through a Buildout recipe was failing part of
the way through.

Two problems and their solutions (not necessarily in that order):

-  Needed to install **libssl-dev** because **lcrypto** was missing
   (ambiguity anyone?) - Synaptic says that the package provides "libssl
   and libcrypto development libraries, header files and manpages" (but
   never mind a search for \`libcrypto\`â€¦)

-  Had to correct the relevant user that the recipe was telling pound to
   build as.

The first point was pretty silly and the second one was just clearly my
copy-and-paste mistake.
