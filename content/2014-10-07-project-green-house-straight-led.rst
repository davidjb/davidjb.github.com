In my `previous post`_, I talked about replacing the various circular
fluorescent tubes in my house over to LEDs.  In this post, I'll cover the
replacement of short, straight T5 fluorescent tubes and discuss the
interesting results I had in this space.

In my house, I have a total of just two of these T5 tubes, both positioned above
the sinks in my respective bathrooms.  They're positioned inside a housing
that essentially acts as recessed lighting, reflecting light from the tube out
in all directions.


Replacement lights

These were the closest direct replacements for T5 tubes I could find, given
their dimensions roughly matched the housing and original tube size.  The
options were quite limited, which is why I ended up having to pay quite a lot
more for these panels than the previous lights I'd purchased.

The replacement LED panels come with a driver for connecting the mains power
to the lights, and the driver accepts worldwide AC voltage.  The page lists
the wattage as "15W" under ordering, but is actually 16W.

The page lists the option of a warm white colour, but in actuality, you can
only pick plain "white".  As it transpires, the colour of these LEDs was
initially quite disappointing, being essentially purple or pink, with a very high
concentration of red.  Oddly, trying to take a photo of this issue wasn't
possible, I presume due to some sort of filtering cameras do.

In time, the light colour moved back towards more of a cool white, perhaps as
the LEDs burn themselves in.  However, it still wasn't perfect, so to improve
the colour, I've taken to using a yellow marker in order to filter out some of
the red and most of the blue in the light, and *roughly* restore the light to
a "natural white", like it was supposed to be the in the first place.


How to
======

This is essentially the same as the `previous post`_, so refer to that page
for greater detail.

Preparation
-----------

Since the fixture is quite a lot smaller, check that the size of the panel being
purchased will fit; this is understandably critical!  In my case, I measured
the size of the light fitting and took into account the small amount of extra
space to be gained by removing the old fluorescent starter and tube holder.

Gather the materials, order the lights, and wait.  Make nice with your
electrician friend and arrange for them to come over and help out when your
lights arrive.

Step by step
------------

Your experience will likely be different, so adapt the instructions to suit
your own light fittings.

#. Fit the magnetic mounts to the LED boards, or for non-ferrous fittings,
   fit Velcro.

#. Ensure all power is disconnected from the light fitting prior to beginning.
   Isolate the circuit the light is connected to, and use a multimeter to
   double-check the voltage before starting.

#. Unscrew and remove all electrical components from the panel.  In this case,
   one would remove the tube, the tube connectors, the electronic ballast, and
   all other fittings.

   All that should remain in the fitting is the mains cable entering the
   terminal block.

#. Fit the LED board, driver and cabling into the light fixture.  This may
   require some crafty routing of cables, depending on the size of your light
   fitting and the space available.

#. Wire the active and neutral wires into the correct part of the terminal
   block, and ensure all screws are secure.  Note that the earth is already
   connected as part of the light fitting itself.

#. The end result looks like this:

#. Turn the power back on, and turn on the light switch.

As per my `previous post`_, the figures above aren't exactly brimming with
precision.  The power meter I was using monitors amps to 2 decimal places only
(and the reading tends to jump around a bit).  From some of the calculations
I've done, these figures aren't even rounded, they're just truncated.  I've
worked backwards using the voltage, amperage, and power factor to get a truer
indication as to the wattage.  The input power I'm working with is slightly
variable as well, being between 246 and 250V AC.

The comparison between the two lights isn't exactly fair or exact.  The LED
panel replacement is a lot brighter than the fluorescent tube, but the fitting
I'm putting the LEDs into is really designed for the 360-degree nature of a
fluorescent tube.  The LEDs have less than 180-degrees of light emission and
results in some of their light being 'trapped' in the fitting.

As you can see above, the energy savings aren't as nearly as dramatic as last
time.  In this case, the current draw from both types of lights is very close
to the same (0.07A compared to 0.06A).  When you consider the accuracy of my
power meter, then this is probably almost statistically irrelevant.


Conclusion
==========

Overall, this replacement, whilst successful, hasn't been as ground-breaking
as the previous circular fluorescent replacement.  There will always be the
environmental benefits of not using mercury lamps and (hopefully) not having
to replace the lights ever again.

The power savings are slight, but not nearly as significant as before. I would
take an educated guess as to it being a combination of the following:

* Unsuitable light fitting, requiring a higher power of LED to achieve a
  suitable brightness.
* Higher efficiency of the original T5 tubes compared to circular fluorescent
  tubes
* Lack of efficiency of these new LED panels

The first point is probably the most notable.  Last time, with the circular
LEDs, the light fittings are purely mono-directional: downwards.  This means
that the fluorescent tubes are essentially wasting power with their 360-degree
light emission around the circular tube, with light being emitted onto
surfaces inside the fitting that aren't directly seen.  By contrast, the
circular LEDs purely output light downwards onto the diffuser cover, and out
into the room.  This stands to be more efficient, requiring less overall
light, and thus less power, meaning a lower-power LED panel can equate to a
higher wattage of a fluorescent tube.

As you can see above, in the straight fitting, the light escapes from the top
and bottom, passing through slightly frosted glass.  With the original T5
tube emitting 360 degrees of light, a lot of this light directly escapes the
fitting, with a small proportion reflecting off the front cover.  The LED
panel replacements only output light in a forward direction, with most
light relying on reflection against the front cover in order to escapes into
the room.  As a result, it is going to take a greater amount of light and
power to produce roughly the same light output.

The cost of LEDs is significant in this case and whilst financial riches
aren't going to be gained from the power savings, the capital outlay should be
paid back eventually, since a replacement T5 tube costs just shy of $7 AUD.

Stay tuned for more of the same as the remainder of the house gets converted
to LEDs and made more efficient!
