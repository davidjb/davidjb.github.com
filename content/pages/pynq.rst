PyNQ

Back in 2013 and 2014, I had grand plans for starting an enthusiasts group in
North Queensland dedicated to the Python programming language.  It was one of
those crazy ideas  I tend to get when inspired by the genius that is PyCon AU
(like prepping a full-blown talk the night before).

Despite there being quite a few people around using Python, PyNQ never really
got off the ground.  I remember a lightning talk I did at PyCon AU a few years
back with a shameless plug for the ethereal group, which was humorously met
with silence.

It might because I'm in a regional area and most of us tend to be more
generalists or whether there's just not enough people in the region at this
stage; we might never know.  A key thing I noted was that those who were
interested were at the beginner or never-used-Python stage.  This is a great
sign for Python, but I wasn't setting out to create a training school.

So, the greatest of intentions don't always work out.  I'm happy to say I
tried all the same.  It was back in 2014 though and the world is changing
with Raspberry Pis, microcontrollers and more seeing Python picking up pace
and becoming the go-to language for burgeoning programmers.

If you're a wayward soul who finds their way here one day, I'm still keen to
revisit the idea of PyNQ, but I can't go it alone.  If you're that kind of
person who's passionate about programming, technology and Python, then get in
touch, even if it's just to say hi or grab a coffee.

Until then.
