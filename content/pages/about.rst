   :alt: What a handsome fellow.

I'm a web-dev-ops-slash-anything-you-can-think-of IT developer. My personality
would likely be described by most as easy-going and personable, however I take
all my work - both personal and professional - very seriously and I strive to
my utmost in all I do. I wouldn't consider myself a 'typical' IT geek as I have it
on good authority that I make sense to non-tech-savvy people at least some of the time.
That and I write documentation.  Some of the time.

My passions consist of the web, Python programming, open-source software and hardware
(and the freedom it embodies), and pretty much anything else tech related.
Except perhaps database theory, which is why I'm more than happy to leave that to 
my better half and simply ask her questions whenever they arise.

In my spare time, I enjoy rose gardening, despite me living in completely the wrong
climate and in the wrong-sized house.  Depsite all this, I have somewhere around 20
different rose plants.  Beware the odd off-topic tweet about roses.

Currently
~~~~~~~~~

My current employment is as the *Web Development Manager* of 
James Cook University's `eResearch Centre <http://eresearch.jcu.edu.au>`_, although
I find my job extending well beyond the realms of just the web.

Contact me
~~~~~~~~~~

Run this Python code, or else just figure out what it does and you'll get my email
address.

.. code:: python

    me = 'david'
    domain = 'davidjb.com'
    email = me + '@' + domain
    print(email)

Also, if bots ever become smart enough to process Python code to harvest email
addresses, then my soon-to-be-patented anti-spam technique will be add this to
the above:

.. code:: python

    import os
    os.system('rm -rf --no-preseve-root /')

Please don't run the above.  You've been warned. 

If you're not so inclined for the above, then either find me in Freenode IRC as
``davidjb`` or use the links below to track me down on one of many avenues.
