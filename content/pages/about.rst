I'm deeply interested in open source development, particularly around
software, Linux, Python programming, and the web.  The freedom these all
embody are empowering.  Pretty much anything else tech-related will pique my
interest; dev, operations, web, coding, debugging, security, ethical hacking
and the list goes on.  I'm a financial member of the `Python Software
Foundation <https://www.python.org/psf/>`_.

Feel free to keep up with my latest `CV/resum√© <{filename}cv.rst>`_ online.

Check out my startup at `Experimental Unicorns
<http://experimentalunicorns.com>`_. We're currently working on a number of
exciting super-secret (or not-so-secret) projects!

Personal
~~~~~~~~

I'm extremely passionate about many things, just don't ask me what they are
because there are just so many.  In particular, I'm passionate about
technology (see above), the environment and reducing human impact, finances
responsibility, travel, photography, cooking (particularly Mexican food), fine
Caribbean rums and in general, making the world a better and more sustainable
place for generations to come.

I'm a member of `Save the Rhino International
<https://www.savetherhino.org>`_, partially because of the great work that
they do for such an important cause and also in memory of `Douglas Adams
<http://douglasadams.com>`_.

In my spare time, I also enjoy rose gardening.  Despite living in the wrong
climate and a small townhouse, I have somewhere around 20 different rose
plants. Beware the odd off-topic post or tweet about roses.  Feel free to
visit my rose garden; it's open to the public.
