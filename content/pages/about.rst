I do development, handle system operations, work with the web, and fix
people's code.  I write documentation, especially if you don't.

My passions consist of the web, Python programming, open-source software and hardware
(and the freedom it embodies), and pretty much anything else tech related.
Except perhaps database theory, which is why I'm more than happy to leave that to
my fianc√©, and ask her questions whenever they arise.

In my spare time, I enjoy rose gardening.  Despite living in the wrong climate
and a small townhouse, I have somewhere around 20 different rose plants.
Beware the odd off-topic tweet about roses.


Contact me
~~~~~~~~~~

Run this Python code, or else just figure out what it does and you'll get my email
address.

.. code:: python

    me = 'david'
    domain = 'davidjb.com'
    email = me + '@' + domain
    print(email)

Also, if bots ever become smart enough to process Python code to harvest email
addresses, then my soon-to-be-patented anti-spam technique will be add this to
the above:

.. code:: python

    import os
    os.system('rm -rf --no-preserve-root /')

Please don't run the above.  You've been warned. 

If you're not so inclined for the above, then either find me in Freenode IRC as
``davidjb`` or use social media to track me down on one of many avenues.
