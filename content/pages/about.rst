I'm extremely passionate about open source development, particularly around
software, Linux, Python programming, and the web.  The freedom these all
embody are empowering.  Pretty much anything else tech-related will pique my
interest.

I do development, handle system operations, work with the web, and fix
people's code.  I write documentation, especially if you don't.

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm always available for consulting or similar opportunities and can be
contracted remotely.  You can `contact me`_ below.

Feel free to keep up with my latest `CV/resum√© <|filename|cv.rst>`_ online.


Spare time
~~~~~~~~~~

In my spare time, I enjoy rose gardening.  Despite living in the wrong climate
and a small townhouse, I have somewhere around 20 different rose plants.
Beware the odd off-topic post or tweet about roses.

Contact me
~~~~~~~~~~

Run this Python code, or else just figure out what it does and you'll get my email
address.

.. code:: python

    me = 'david'
    domain = 'davidjb.com'
    email = me + '@' + domain
    print(email)

Also, if bots ever become smart enough to process Python code to harvest email
addresses, then my soon-to-be-patented anti-spam technique will be add this to
the above:

.. code:: python

    import os
    os.system('rm -rf --no-preserve-root /')

Please don't run the above.  You've been warned. 

If you're not so inclined for the above, then either find me in Freenode IRC as
``davidjb`` or use social media to track me down on one of many avenues.
