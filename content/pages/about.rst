I'm extremely passionate about open source development, particularly around
software, Linux, Python programming, and the web.  The freedom these all
embody are empowering.  Pretty much anything else tech-related will pique my
interest; dev, operations, web, coding.  

Check out my startup at `Experimental Unicorns
<http://experimentalunicorns.com>`_. We're currently working on a number of
exciting super-secret (or not-so-secret) projects!

Feel free to keep up with my latest `CV/resum√© <|filename|cv.rst>`_ online.

Spare time
~~~~~~~~~~

In my spare time, I enjoy rose gardening.  Despite living in the wrong climate
and a small townhouse, I have somewhere around 20 different rose plants.
Beware the odd off-topic post or tweet about roses.
