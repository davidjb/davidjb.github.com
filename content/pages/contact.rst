Online
~~~~~~

Hit me up via any of the social media icons at the left or above.  Twitter is
probably likely to get my attention quickest, second only to email, below.

Email
~~~~~

Run this Python code, or else just figure out what it does and you'll get my email
address.

.. code:: python

    me = 'david'
    domain = 'davidjb.com'
    email = me + '@' + domain
    print(email)

Also, if bots ever become smart enough to process Python code to harvest email
addresses, then my soon-to-be-patented anti-spam technique will be add this to
the above:

.. code:: python

    import os
    os.system('rm -rf --no-preserve-root /')

Please don't run the above.  You've been warned. 

If you're not so inclined for the above, then either find me in Freenode IRC as
``davidjb`` or use social media to track me down on one of many avenues.
