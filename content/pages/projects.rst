* **James Cook University Research Portfolio** (http://jcu.me) - Lead developer

  A full-featured profiles system for the University's research staff.  The site
  collates data from various internal and external systems for display against
  each researcher.  Researchers also have the ability to self-contribute relevant
  information, learn how to correct erroneous information, and discover connections
  they never knew they had. Information is shared publicly to demonstrate the richness
  of research at the University. 

  The site goes live to the world in May 2013 and will replace several existing
  systems in doing so.

  The project was build using a large swag of open-source tools, including:

  * Pyramid web framework - http://www.pylonsproject.org/
  * SQLAlchemy - http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
  * Deform - http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/
  * Colander - http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/colander/
  * ColanderAlchemy - http://colanderalchemy.rtfd.org
  * Fanstatic - http://www.fanstatic.org 
  * Natural - http://natural.rtfd.org/
  * ...and more.


Personal projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Web-accessible irrigation automation

  * Must be open-source
  * `OpenSprinkler <http://www.opensprinkler.com/>`_ looks great, but it has some
    limitations at present, including how its web interface works.
  * I'm aiming for an open-source web interface beyond what it currently offers.

* Starting a Python North Queensland (PyNQ: http://pynq.org) user group

  * Still gathering interest at present.

* Blog & static site improvements

  * This blog!  (Meta, isn't it?)
