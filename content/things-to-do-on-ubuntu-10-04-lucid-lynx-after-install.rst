I'm skipping actually quantifying the number of things to do because
this post will undoubtedly get updated as time goes on.Â  I've just
updated both my computers (personal laptop and work desktop) to Ubuntu
10.04 from 9.10 and I'm very happy with how things have gone. That isn't
to say a few minor things haven't annoyed me, such as Project Hamster
removing its Day view for task management or Python 2.4 being dropped
entirely, but overall, it's gone well. Here's my thoughts on what you
should do as soon as you've made the jump (or installed).

#. **Set up Plymouth (graphical boot) and Virtual Terminals for
   High-resolution:** `Tux's Idyllic Life`_ has a perfect guide that has
   worked for both my machines with proprietary Nvidia drivers
   installed.
#. **Learn how to change the splash screen image (and install some new
   ones):** see `Ubuntu Geek's guide`_
#. **Follow the next 10 steps** over at `OMG Ubuntu's guide`_ - you
   might have already done some of these, but it's a very useful
   combined post.

More to come as time progresses...
