Taking a little bit of a time-out, I just have to ask the question: is
Buildout not the best thing ever? (and the people who are so very kind
to make the recipes?)

It's made my work of managing our Plone infrastructure about 1000 times
simpler since moving from Instancemanager (ughhh) and having to manually
manage everything. I remember being a bit sceptical and very confused
the first time I saw a buildout configuration file and thought that I'd
never understand the thing.

Far, far from it of course! Whilst a little daunting at first, buildout
has (in some/all metaphorical senses) won my heart. It couldn't be
easier to use, contrary to my initial (dis)beliefs.

Today sees me convert our archaic design of manually managing our
Varnish RPMs and setup and changing it to buildout instead. Looks like
the geniuses (and there's no sarcasm here!) have made it perfectly - it
does exactly what I need it to and makes my job so much simpler.
