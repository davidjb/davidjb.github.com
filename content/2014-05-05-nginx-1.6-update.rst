.. note::
   This was discussed in a `previous post
   <{filename}/2013-04-22-nginx-shibboleth-fastcgi.rst>`_. Various changes
   have happened since then, improving the customisation process and updating
   for newer versions of Nginx and associated add-on modules.

I've updated the custom version of Nginx that supports operating with a
Shibboleth SP to version 1.6.0, now that this version has become the lastest
stable version.

The build scripts located at
https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/nginx-custom-build have been updated, along
with the patches required to make the Shibboleth integration happen due to the
changes in the Auth Request Module now being built into Nginx since version
1.5.4.  Some other minor adjustments were required to keep patches up with
module changes in Nginx's core.

See
https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/nginx-custom-build/blob/master/CHANGES.rst
for a complete listing of changes. Feel free to watch the repository for
changes and updates!
