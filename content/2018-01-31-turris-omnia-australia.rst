Ordering a Turris Omnia in Australia (2018 pricing)

The `Turris Omnia <https://omnia.turris.cz/>`_ is an amazing home router.  Not
only did it start from humble beginnings from a crowd-funding campaign but
it's open source, has a huge community and supported by CZ.nic, the
association responsible for domain names the Czech Republic.

I won't wax lyrical about the benefits of the device as you can discover that
for yourself, but rather I'll tell you how you can order one of these if you
happen to live in a country where the the resellers don't ship to.  The
devices are sold through Amazon.de and various `other places
<https://omnia.turris.cz/en/#buy>`_ and they'll happily ship within Europe,
but to outside, like me in Australia, I thought I was out of luck.

Turns out Discomp (https://www.discomp.cz), one of the distributors for the
Turris Omnia will actually ship internationally.  This digging took me a while
but yes, it's possible and they'll sell you any of the following models:

* Turris Omnia 1 GB No Wi-Fi - 209,00 USD
* Turris Omnia 1 GB Wi-Fi - 259,00 USD
* Turris Omnia 2 GB Wi-Fi - 299,00 USD

In terms of other resellers like Amazon.de, you're getting a good deal
because their price of EUR309 is more like US$334 and even if you were to get
a freight forwarder, you'd still be paying VAT.

Anyway, it isn't cheap to ship from the Czech Republic to anywhere - I ended
up paying USD$97 (AUD$126 at time of writing) but it’s via UPS Expedited.
Shipping costs looked like:

* UPS Express is 104,00 USD
* UPS Expedited is 97,00 USD
* EMS (Post) is 99,00 USD
* Priority Post is 73,50 USD (long transport time, w/0 insurance)

Since you don’t pay VAT on the router itself, this killer postage cost almost
balances out.  Compared with other routers I was considering, this total cost
of around AUD$490 with shipping, isn't that bad.

To order, email `info@discomp.cz <mailto:info@discomp.cz>`_ and give them your
address to confirm shipping costs as well as which model you want to order.
Then, they'll send you back confirmation of what you're ordering and your
address and then finally you can pay via credit card to seal the deal.

Then, wait for your new router to arrive. That's it.
