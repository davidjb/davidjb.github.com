Well, it's a sad state of affairs when simply unplugging your set of USB
headphones causes your Intrepid Ibex install of Ubuntu to crap itself.
Even with the same set of headphones plugged back into the same port not
10 seconds later. Painful.

But, the good news is that after a few hours of pain, PulseAudio works
and it's magical in comparison to the older audio systems (3 apps
playing audio at once..wow).

Check out `http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=789578`_ for a great
walk-through on how to set it up on Hardy or Intrepid. Unfortunately,
Skype doesn't play ball (and presumably any other recording software)
with audio input through Pulse, but audio works straight from the USB
headset itself.
