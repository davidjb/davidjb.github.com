Travel Hack: Cheapest Australian Airport Transport Options
##########################################################

:category: Travel
:tags: travel, personal

Australia is an expensive place to travel - well, at least in terms of
services attached to *airports*.  For some reason, Australia loves to jack up
the prices of everything at an airport like food, drinks and of course
*transport* when trying to get to the airport or escape it.  Even though the
CBDs of our cities are fairly close to their respective airports (Melbourne is
one exception), the `privatisation <https://www.airportlink.com.au/company/>`_
of train links sees the costs stay high.

So how does one break the cycle of having to pay over AUD$18 to get from
somewhere like Brisbane Airport to the city, or over AUD$18 to go from Sydney
Airport to the CBD?  By reading on, of course, and learning which alternate
modes of transport will get you there for a fraction of the cost.  Just bear
in mind if you're in a hurry, this isn't for you.  Likewise, if you have heavy
bags and/or a few people, a taxi or ride-share is a fine option instead.

You need a contactless transport card for each of the non-regional locations
below to get the best pricing, and increasingly, actually being able to travel
*at all* as time goes on. Buy a card on arrival at a newsagent, transport
vending machine or train station nearby at the airport.  Your mileage may vary
so just ask around on arrival.

Brisbane
========

Route
    Brisbane Airport to CBD (Central Station)
Standard Route
    Train via AirTrain ($18.50, around 20 mins without waiting, up to 50 mins with
    waiting for train)
Optimised route
    Bus/public train ($3.96, ~60 mins)
Transport Card
    Go Card (https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card). Purchase one
    at the train station if starting at at the airport or at convenience stores or
    newsagents if elsewhere

Brisbane's got two airport terminals, Domestic and International, physically
separated but connected by road (free bus connection) or a train line (paid).

Leaving either terminal is the same cost and is typically by way of the
`AirTrain <https://airtrain.com.au/>`_, a private segment of railway that
connects into south-east Queensland's TransLink network once you leave the
airport area.  Whilst convenient and easy, the train is expensive because of
the "private" part of the line.  You can avoid this though by using a
combination of other methods.

From the airport:

#. Take the free orange Skygate/T-Bus from your terminal to Skygate shopping
   centre, otherwise known as DFO), ensure that it is the Skygate bus and not
   the International Transfer Bus.  The Skygate bus stops right at the public
   bus stop so just get off and wait.

#. From Skygate/DFO, catch the public 590 Bus to Toombul Interchange.

#. From here, walk a short distance across the road to Toombul Station.

#. Take any south-bound train (Cleveland Line) and that
   will get you into the CBD.  If you're CBD-bound, get off where you so choose, such as Central
   Station.  If you're Gold Coast-bound, change at Eagle Junction and jump on
   the train coming from the airport.

For getting back to or going to the airport, do the same as above, just in
reverse:

#. Get yourself to Toombul Station from wherever you are (via the Shorncliffe
   Line). Changing at Eagle Junction is easiest if coming from the Gold Coast.

#. Catch the 590 bus to Skygate/DFO.  The bus dropped me at **Skygate Brisbane
   Airport Stand 2** so it's a very short walk back to Stand 1 to get the next
   bus.

#. Catch the free orange Skygate bus from **Skygate Brisbane Airport Stand 1**
   to the appropriate terminal.

The only catch, aside from the additional time and transfers required, is that
the Skygate bus runs from around `6am to 6pm
<https://skygate.com.au/files/airportvillage/Bus%20Timetable.pdf>`_. If you
have an earlier or later flight, your only option is the train, up until
around 10pm.  After that time your only options are taxi, ride sharing or
private vehicle.

The Skygate bus is well-equipped to carry baggage but the public bus to/from
Toombul is less suited for large bags.  It's not a very long trip though, just
two stops, so you could make it work with luggage if you had to.

Sydney
======

Route
    Sydney Airport to CBD (Circular Quay)
Standard Route
    Train via AirportLink ($18.70, 20 mins)
Optimised route
    Bus/public train or bus/bus ($2.67 with bus, 30-40 mins; or $2.47 with
    walk, 60 mins)
Transport card
    Opal Card (https://opal.com.au/). Purchase at most convenience stores,
    including ones at the airport.

Sydney's got two airport terminals, Domestic and International, physically
separated but connected by road (now a free bus connection) or a train line
(paid).

Leaving either terminal is the same cost and is typically by way of the
`AirportLink <https://www.airportlink.com.au/>`_, a private segment of railway
that connects into Sydney's city train network once you leave the airport
area.  Whilst convenient and easy, the train is expensive because of the
"private" part of the line which leads to a "station access fee" being charged
if you exit at either the Domestic Airport or International Airport Stations.
You can avoid this though by a combination strategy.

From the airport:

#. Find the Public Bus stand outside **Terminal 3**.  You're looking for a
   yellow vertical sign that says *Public Bus* or separately marked by the
   standard blue **â’·** TransportNSW symbol indicating a bus service.

#. Take the **400 PrePay-Only - Sydney Airport to Bondi Junction via
   Eastgardens** bus or the **420 Burwood to Eastgardens** bus from the
   airport.

   * If you're super-stingy, want the exercise and want to save 20 cents,
     walk from the airport to Mascot instead.  With this, add at least 20 minutes
     to your travel time or longer if your bags are heavy.

#. Get off at **Mascot Station, Coward St, Stand A** (ask the driver to stop or
   use your phone to know when to press the button) -- it's only a short trip,
   around 4 mins.

#. From here, walk to Mascot Station just around the corner behind where the bus
   drops you off.

#. Take the train from Mascot to the city (such as to Circular Quay).

For getting back to or to go to the airport, do the same as above, but in reverse:

#. Get onto an Airport-bound train and get off **early** at Mascot Station.

   * Ignore anyone who spots your luggage and gives you odd looks or tries to
     tell you it isn't the airport (you know what you're doing!).
   * If you mess up and miss Mascot, either suck it up and pay the full fare
     at the airport station or for the really adventurous, change trains
     without leaving the station, get back to Mascot and carry on.

#. Exit Mascot Station and walk up to **Coward Street, Stand B** (make sure it
   is **Stand B** or you'll be going the wrong way).

#. Take either the **400 PrePay-Only - Bondi Junction to Sydney Airport via
   Eastgardens** or the **420 Eastgardens to Burwood via Sydney Airport &
   Rockdale** bus towards the airport.

#. Get off at your relevant airport terminal.  If you accidentally get off at
   Domestic but need to go to the International or vice versa, catch the
   `free shuttle bus <https://www.sydneyairport.com.au/airport-guide/arriving/international/getting-between-terminals>`_
   to change terminals.

The only catch, aside from the time factor, is that the bus and trains run
only from 5am to around 1am, excepting the **420N** night service which runs
hourly.  This bus only stops at Terminal 1 (International) and the free T-Bus
service only runs from 6am to 8.50pm. At this point, taxi, ride-share or
private vehicle are your best bets to either get to the airport or leave and
make your way to your destination.  We can only travel hack so far.

Melbourne
=========

Route
    Melbourne (Tullermarine) Airport to CBD (Southern Cross Station)
Standard Route
    Bus via SkyBus ($16.50 each way online as return journey, 30-45 mins)
Optimised route
    Bus/public train ($7.24 weekday/$6.30 weekend or free, 60 mins)
Transport card
    MyKi Card (https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/). Purchase at the
    SkyBus terminal at the airport (ensure you **do not** buy a Skybus
    ticket!) if starting there, on the bus itself, or at most convenience
    stores.

Melbourne has two different airports, Tullamarine (the main airport where the
international terminal is) and Avalon.  Having never been to Avalon, I can't
(yet) comment on its transport methods and so will only be talking about
**Tullamarine**.

Tullamarine is a long way out of town and for whatever particular reason,
there's no train service directly to the airport.  This means that the
ten-tonne gorilla that is SkyBus more-or-less has a monopoly over the
transport heading towards the CBD.  However, that doesn't mean they're your
*only* option.  Here's how to break their business model.

I'll note that when I say "free" it's that your airport trip could be free if
you've done some other travelling on your MyKi card on that day.  For
instance, if you've just been shooting around looking at the sights outside
the free tram zone earlier in the day, you might have hit your "Daily fare"
limit already, meaning your travel to the airport is free!  Same goes for
further travel after your arrive - on a weekeday, you'll get really close to
hitting your daily cap so make the most of it and travel hard through the rest
of the day.

I digress.  Travel from the airport looks like this:

#. Take the **901 SmartBus to Frankston** from near Terminal 4.  If you've
   arrived on a Qantas flight in Terminal 1 this is a good 15 minutes walk.

#. Get off at **Broadmeadows Station** (ask the driver to stop or
   use your phone to know when to press the button) -- it's about 20 minutes,
   depending on traffic and others on the bus.

#. From the bus stop here, walk to the station itself and take a train to
   **Southern Cross Station**.

For getting back to or to go to the airport, do the same above, just in reverse:

#. Get to **Broadmeadows Station** in some manner via train.  You don't need
   to always start at Southern Cross Station, you can start from Flinders
   Street or elsewhere.

#. Walk out of the station and down to the bus stop for the **901 SmartBus to
   Melbourne Airport** -- be careful as there are two different 901 buses that
   stop here.  Make sure yours says "airport" or just ask the driver.

#. Get off at the last stop, Terminal 4 at the airport.  If you're travelling
   from T1, T2 or T3, start walking.

The only catch, aside from the time factor, is that the bus and trains run
only from 6.30am to around 12.10am.  After this point, it's back to the SkyBus
for you, which thankfully runs all night.  Except, of course, for their hotel
transfer service, which ends early in the evening.

Lastly, don't forget about the Free Tram Zone in the city.  You don't need to
tap on or off, just get on and enjoy the free rides.  It's awesome.


Gold Coast
==========

The Gold Coast is easy -- there's nothing special here in terms of transport.
You can catch a public bus right from in front of the airport.  There's no
rail or light rail located at the airport at the time of writing, but there
are future plans to connect the TransLink rain network at some point in the
future.

Townsville
==========

Route
    Townsville Airport to CBD
Standard Route
    Taxi (approx $25, 10 mins)
Optimised Route
    Walk + Bus ($3.00, 30+ mins)

Townsville's public transport options are very limited at the best of times
and the airport is no exception.  The standard option is a taxi (immediate) or
ride-share (if wait times are short enough) from out the front of the airport,
if you don't already have your own private ride.  For public transport:

#. Walk off the airport grounds to Meenan Street

#. Catch either the 205 or 215 Bus (northbound) and get off at the end of the
   line in the CBD.

This bus route doesn't operate on Sunday (!), weekday evenings after 8pm or
Saturdays after 6pm.
