Welcome to my new website and in particular, my new blog. My aim is to
use this site now and slowly (but surely!) move away from the old haunts
of Wikidot. It's especially intelligent considering that I'm actually
paying for webspace on a yearly basis (albeit not much money) but I
figure I should be using it all the same.

So, without further ado - I declare my new site open for business. Much
like Queensland Transport and the local city council around here, the
road is under construction. So, please don't blame me (to my face ;) )
for any potholes you might hit.  It's a work in progress, so bear with
me!

Lots of fun, games, pain, and Plone are to come.  Seems almost ironic
I'm using WordPress as my CMS whilst I spout the joys (et cetera) of
Plone all the time.  For all those people who are curious (oh, there's
plenty I'm sure...): my shared webhost here doesn't offer Python, and
I'm not paying for a dedicated server.  Short and simple; it's about the
money (when is it not).

So, stay tuned!
