There's a tool for everything somewhere on the web.

Whilst about 99.5% perfect (some indentation issues remain), I've found
a pretty nice, easy to use, and very feature-rich HTML code formatter. 
See http://www.mycoolform.com/index.php?lang=en for the formatter.

It's something I was looking for a while back but didn't have so much
luck to stumble onto something so useful.  Previously, I was looking for
something that would fix up some HTML to XHTML and whilst I'm sure
something was out there, the problem was I needed something that would
do the job, but stay away from TAL attributes on my elements.  The
things that I had found did "too good" of a job and dumped those
elements, which is fair enough because things like 'tal:content=' isn't
valid XHTML.

This formatted though does new lines, auto-indentation, change of case
for tags and attributes (hello XHTML compliance), comment removal and
white space elimination.  Great stuff; so many thanks to its author (who
is anonymous I guess?).
