</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So, I'm the proud owner of a set of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.logitech.com/en-gb/speakers-audio/headphones/devices/223">Logitech Premium Notebook
Headset</a>. I purchased these headphones a fair while ago - around 2
years - and just like any set of headphones, the foam ear pads
deteriorated away when I took them out to use them after a long spell in
storage. Usually, this wouldn't be a problem if it were a set of
headphones that used a standard shaped ear pad -- just buy some
replacement foam pages and put them on. These headphones aren't so, with
the shape being more like a D shape rather than an oval or circle.</p>
<p>Now, Googling around lead me to find posts like <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Headphones-Headsets-Microphones/Premium-Notebook-Headset-Foam-Earpad-Replacements/td-p/87499">this</a> discussing that
Logitech don't sell replacement pads. That post's pretty old but it's
still relevant, since I can't find anywhere that mentions a solution.
People might want to give up and buy another set, but I for one am not
going to settle for letting a $60 pair of headphones go to waste for
such a trivial reason. In addition, looking around on eBay for <strong>cheap</strong>
replacement foam pads meant it was circular pads or bust. Hmm.&nbsp; This
post covers how to quickly and cheaply <em>replace your pads</em>!</p>
<p>The short answer is to buy this or similar:
<a class="reference external" href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=160508622179">http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=160508622179</a>--
it's a 4.5cm-diameter (45mm) black foam pad, with a good amount of depth
to it (for stretching). Buy this, and replace your pads. Problem solved
for a mere <strong>$2</strong> including shipping (give or take)..and I got 4 pairs
of pads.&nbsp; For a more detailed outline, read on.</p>
<p>So, my solution is simply buy a suitably sized set of circular pads, and
I have a very good feeling this is what Logitech use. Measuring up my
ear speaker housing on the headphones, I approximated the shape to be an
oval. Thanks to the fact foam has a bit of flexibility and give, I
figured that you can &quot;squish&quot; a circular pad, and have it almost form
the right shape. Using some maths, I calculated what sort of circle size
could be squashed to result in a correctly-sized oval (eg reduce height
to increase width) and the answer is a <strong>4.5cm (45mm) foam pad</strong>.</p>
<p>I've since discarded my actual working out, but my working depended on
the axiom that the foam pad's area (in a 2D plane) remains constant when
being squished.&nbsp; Whether my theory and calculations were perfect, I
don't know, but I do know that I bought that given item from eBay, and
with the tiniest amount of manipulation, the pads slipped on and my
headphones are perfect.&nbsp; The fit is nice and snug; seemingly, I won't
need glue to keep them on.&nbsp; Yay for maths in the real world!</p>
<p>The item mentioned above has sold and I'm not sure if the seller has any
more (or will have in 2 years when I need more pads!).&nbsp; In any case, as
long as the pads are that diameter, and have a decent depth/height to
them (eg will fit around the earphones and be held in place), then you
should be fine.</p>
<p>Good luck fixing your headsets.</p>
