For
those of you that don't know, it's a great site that lists opportunities
to view satellites that will be visible in your location and when/where
to look to see them. Amongst the fact this service exists and is free, I
was amazed (and thankful!) that it actually lists lots of different
locations, one of which is where I like in regional Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a great setup and they offer an RSS feed for each location which
keeps you updated. That's great, but if I'm trying to manage my time, I
don't really want to have be porting information between my Google
Reader and my Google Calendar manually. This wasn't a problem when I
wanted to insert one or two records into my calendar, but since this
feed always gets updated, it's clogging my Reader and less useful this
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never to let a good thing go, I decided to resolve this issue by using
my new favourite tool, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/"&gt;Yahoo Pipes&lt;/a&gt;. Read on for how to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've not heard of Yahoo Pipes, I encourage you to go and take a
look. It's not exactly the easiest tool to use, granted, but it is
extremely powerful for as they say &amp;quot;rewiring the web&amp;quot; (oh, it's FREE so
you don't need to use your own computing resources!). There are a number
of oddities in how it does business, but the end result is extremely
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to what I've built, check out
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=853d413076c16a20cc0c219188158033"&gt;http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=853d413076c16a20cc0c219188158033&lt;/a&gt;
for the Pipe. Here's the instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/"&gt;http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/&lt;/a&gt; and locate
the RSS feed for your location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make note of your location's time offset, plus or minus hour many
hours GMT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have these, go to my Pipe at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=853d413076c16a20cc0c219188158033"&gt;http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=853d413076c16a20cc0c219188158033&lt;/a&gt;
and input the URL and time offset in the relevant boxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click 'Run Pipe'. If successful, you should see a list of sightings
(assuming they exist for your location and time!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click onto 'More options' on the left-hand side and choose 'Get as
iCal'. Copy this URL into your calendaring product, like Google
Calendar, and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you'll need to update your time offset when/if you change into
or out of daylight saving time - you can just go back to my Pipe and do
that to get your new calendar URL. I might see what I can do in the
future about this, but since my location doesn't have daylight saving,
you can understand why auto-changing isn't a feature :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy this creation! As long as I stay interested, I'll keep it running
as best I can. However, given the nature of people's websites to change
formatting, I can't guarantee that NASA won't break my Pipe. Also, I
give no guarantees that this will work for anything but the one location
I live in because I don't test anything but this one RSS feed as an
input.&lt;/p&gt;
