easy as opening the case, inserting the card, and booting the machine
(then Xorg config etc). Well, to tell the truth, I just moved my HDD,
peripherals (gfx card included) to a new box - now a Dell OptiPlex 755.
But, it's not that easy if you can't boot your Ubuntu 8.10 OS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer kept spitting this message out, even though it just worked
a few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
15.848000 NVRM: This PCI I/O region assigned to your NVIDIA device is invalid:
15.848000 NVRM: BAR1 is 0M &amp;#64; 0x00000000 (PCI:0001:00.0)
15.848000 NVRM: The system BIOS may have misconfigured your graphics card.
15.848000 NVRM: The NVIDIA probe routine failed for 1 device(s)
15.848000 NVRM: None of the NVIDIA graphics adapters were initialized!
15.848000 NVRM: This PCI I/O region assigned to your NVIDIA device is invalid:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much pain, I managed to get into the computer and have the network
loaded up (yay). Some hours of searching, I'd stumbled onto Dell's
Official solution to driver updates (biosdisk); no luck because the boot
disk wouldn't load the EXE. Tried the official method from Ubuntu's
wiki; no luck since my BIOS couldn't be found in the package repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final ditch effort to do it manually led me to this:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bigbrovar.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/upgrade-downgrade-your-dell-bios-on-ubuntu/"&gt;http://bigbrovar.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/upgrade-downgrade-your-dell-bios-on-ubuntu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, it works! Turns out on my system I didn't even need to edit the
/boot/grub/menu.lst file (BIOS just updates itself upon reboot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, like magic, everything's fine. My whole system is back working
again after just that one (major) fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to work for me…&lt;/p&gt;
