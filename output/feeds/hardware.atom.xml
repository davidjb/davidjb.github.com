with OCZ firmware updates for my Vertex 3 SSD.&amp;nbsp; For whatever reason, OCZ
doesn't provide a news feed of firmware updates (that I know of, correct
me if I'm wrong!) so I've sorted a screen scraping Yahoo Pipes pipe to
do it for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=a1f15d7ead0122567ad6537b2de484a3&amp;amp;_render=rss"&gt;http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=a1f15d7ead0122567ad6537b2de484a3&amp;amp;_render=rss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This RSS feed will (or should) only ever feature just 1 item - the
latest version information for the firmware.&amp;nbsp; So, it won't handle
keeping track of history, but if you (or I) add the feed to something
like Google Reader, that will keep track of changes to the RSS feed for
us/me.&amp;nbsp; So, when the target page on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ocztechnology.com/ssd_tools/OCZ_Vertex_3,_Vertex_3_Max_IOPS,_Agility_3,_Solid_3,_RevoDrive_3_and_RevoDrive_3_X2/"&gt;OCZ's site&lt;/a&gt;changes its version
information, the feed will update, and Google Reader knows
automagically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Pipes and Google Reader strike again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and apparently this firmware isn't just for the Vertex 3, but also
for the OCZ Vertex 3, Vertex 3 Max IOPS, Agility 3, Solid 3, RevoDrive 3
and RevoDrive 3 X2, so anyone using those other drives should be good
too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Since this was written, Dell has released version A10 of
their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/04/DriverDetails/DriverFileFormats?DriverId=N31V7&amp;amp;FileId=2775891360"&gt;OptiPlex 990 BIOS&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;nbsp; I've tested this on my 990 and my
keyboard now works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to anyone out there confused out of their mind if
their Dell keyboard isn't working with their computer during boot: there
is some incompatibility between the OptiPlex 990 and the Dell SK-8135
keyboard.&amp;nbsp; I'm using the A06 BIOS, which is latest at the time of
writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this is that you cannot use the keyboard during boot, so
not within POST, not to enter the boot menu or BIOS, and the keyboard
does not work in my GRUB until I unplug it and plug it in again.&amp;nbsp; I've
tried two of these specific keyboards, revision P and revision S, and
both show the same issue.&amp;nbsp; I've also tried the keyboard on two different
OptiPlex 990 machines, and the result is the same.&amp;nbsp; All sorts of other
keyboards work fine though, and the SK-8135 works fine once you load an
OS -- so through this detective work, there must be something wrong with
the computer (aka with the BIOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just in case you hit the same issue, this is what I've found.&amp;nbsp; If
you find this too, please contact Dell and hopefully we can get a
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:&lt;/strong&gt; This guide is effectively now entirely outdated
with regards to the available tools.  I've gone back to simply using
a Windows boot disk to handle the firmware upgrades, although they've
gotten less frequent as of late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just shelled out a good chunk of money in buying an OCZ Vertex 3
240GB solid state drive (SSD) and it's amazingly quick. So amazingly
quick that I thought I may just have fallen into a coma when I had to
temporarily switch back to my old mechanical hard drive and boot from it
again. And this is only using the Vertex 3 on a SATA II interface - not
even the SATA III it's designed for. I actually just bought a new laptop
with the intention (at least one of ;)) of being able to utilise the
drive's full potential on SATA III, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having only had this drive for a week, I've noticed that there are
firmware upgrades available from the OCZ website, and the Vertex 3's
firmware stands at 2.06 at time of writing. Now, you can upgrade this
firmware (and upgrading did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; erase my drive!) but it's not the
easiest if you're like me and only have a laptop with the SSD as your
only drive. Thankfully, a bit of trial and error on my part got this
licked. Here's a guide to how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as the OCZ site mentions, you can't upgrade a disk that you've
booted off. I've also learned that you need to have your SSD connected
in via a dedicated SATA controller (NOT a USB-to-SATA converter or any
such thing) and in my case of my M1530 laptop, is the internal drive
bay. This means we need to be booting off a USB stick or optical disc -
something Windows essentially won't do easily. Thankfully, this is
something that Linux shines at. And the good news here is that OCZ have
a Linux-based updater tool available. Hurray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what you can do. Warning: your mileage &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; likely vary for
you if using a different laptop, different model version, different
firmware to A12, different SSD firmware, etc, so be very careful
following my words verbatim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Download and install a Linux distribution to a USB stick or burn an
optical disc.&amp;nbsp; In my case, I chose Ubuntu 11.04, because that's what
I'm comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Head to the OCZ forums and download the linked &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?82289-OCZ-SandForce-Linux-based-firmware-update-tool"&gt;Linux OCZ Firmware
Update Tool&lt;/a&gt;. At time of writing, the version is 1.15.&amp;nbsp; Put the zip
or tar file close to hand (eg on the USB stick is a good idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Shut down your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Potentially optional step:&amp;nbsp; change the SATA mode on your drive to
'ATA' (away from 'AHCI') within the BIOS.&amp;nbsp; As far as I had read, this
is necessary.&amp;nbsp; That said,&amp;nbsp; I haven't tried it without doing this as
of yet.&amp;nbsp; When changed, shut down your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Disconnect all power from the computer - in the case of my laptop,
this was the AC and the battery.&amp;nbsp; Wait for a minute before
reconnecting.&amp;nbsp; Apparently this is enough time for the AHCI security
'freeze' to be cleared from the SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Connect power again and boot from your USB stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;When your Linux distro is loaded, inspect your SSD's parameters with
this command, replacing /dev/sda with your drive's device:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;If all is well, then you should see 'not frozen' and 'not locked' in
the output, near the very bottom.&amp;nbsp; If you only see 'frozen' (for
instance) as one of the lines, then your device needs to be unfrozen
before continuing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my case, I had to turn off the swap partition on the drive
(done easily with gparted) and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to suspend and resume my computer whilst on running off the
USB stick.&amp;nbsp; This last point clinched it for me and the security
freeze was lifted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Once you're ready, make sure your computer is connected to the
Internet as the firmware updater downloads the latest version from
OCZ on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Locate your zip/tar of the firmware tool and extract it somewhere
convenient.&amp;nbsp; For argument's sake, I've put mine in my home directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Run the appropriate command from the following to update the firmware
(linux32 is for if you are presently booted into a 32 bit OS and
linux64 is for 64 bit; replacing /dev/sda with your drive's device):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo ~/fwupd\_v115/linux32/fwupd -log /dev/sda
sudo ~/fwupd\_v115/linux64/fwupd -log /dev/sda
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;You should be greeted with a message of success, if it all worked. If
it didn't, then check to make sure your drive isn't reported as
locked or frozen - this is what it was for me 99% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's about it. This guide and how-to is mostly posted for my own
information for later, but hopefully it might help someone else. Like
always, make sure you've backed up your data before beginning anything
like this.&lt;/p&gt;

Headset&lt;/a&gt;. I purchased these headphones a fair while ago - around 2
years - and just like any set of headphones, the foam ear pads
deteriorated away when I took them out to use them after a long spell in
storage. Usually, this wouldn't be a problem if it were a set of
headphones that used a standard shaped ear pad -- just buy some
replacement foam pages and put them on. These headphones aren't so, with
the shape being more like a D shape rather than an oval or circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Googling around lead me to find posts like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Headphones-Headsets-Microphones/Premium-Notebook-Headset-Foam-Earpad-Replacements/td-p/87499"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; discussing that
Logitech don't sell replacement pads. That post's pretty old but it's
still relevant, since I can't find anywhere that mentions a solution.
People might want to give up and buy another set, but I for one am not
going to settle for letting a $60 pair of headphones go to waste for
such a trivial reason. In addition, looking around on eBay for &lt;strong&gt;cheap&lt;/strong&gt;
replacement foam pads meant it was circular pads or bust. Hmm.&amp;nbsp; This
post covers how to quickly and cheaply &lt;em&gt;replace your pads&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is to buy this or similar:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=160508622179"&gt;http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=160508622179&lt;/a&gt;--
it's a 4.5cm-diameter (45mm) black foam pad, with a good amount of depth
to it (for stretching). Buy this, and replace your pads. Problem solved
for a mere &lt;strong&gt;$2&lt;/strong&gt; including shipping (give or take)..and I got 4 pairs
of pads.&amp;nbsp; For a more detailed outline, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my solution is simply buy a suitably sized set of circular pads, and
I have a very good feeling this is what Logitech use. Measuring up my
ear speaker housing on the headphones, I approximated the shape to be an
oval. Thanks to the fact foam has a bit of flexibility and give, I
figured that you can &amp;quot;squish&amp;quot; a circular pad, and have it almost form
the right shape. Using some maths, I calculated what sort of circle size
could be squashed to result in a correctly-sized oval (eg reduce height
to increase width) and the answer is a &lt;strong&gt;4.5cm (45mm) foam pad&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've since discarded my actual working out, but my working depended on
the axiom that the foam pad's area (in a 2D plane) remains constant when
being squished.&amp;nbsp; Whether my theory and calculations were perfect, I
don't know, but I do know that I bought that given item from eBay, and
with the tiniest amount of manipulation, the pads slipped on and my
headphones are perfect.&amp;nbsp; The fit is nice and snug; seemingly, I won't
need glue to keep them on.&amp;nbsp; Yay for maths in the real world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The item mentioned above has sold and I'm not sure if the seller has any
more (or will have in 2 years when I need more pads!).&amp;nbsp; In any case, as
long as the pads are that diameter, and have a decent depth/height to
them (eg will fit around the earphones and be held in place), then you
should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck fixing your headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
