website.  Being a Python developer that I am, it&amp;#8217;s not exactly good form, nor
is it good for one&amp;#8217;s sanity to have to keep updating something every few days
with security updates.  Maybe I&amp;#8217;m giving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; applications and Wordpress a hard time
given their prevalence out in the wild, but the fact remains that it just wasn&amp;#8217;t
working for me.  It might also have a little to do with the fact that my existing
web host has decided to increase my costs by about 1000% per year (yes, that&amp;#8217;s a
10-fold increase).  Either way, I&amp;#8217;ll pass on&amp;nbsp;both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-path"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New&amp;nbsp;path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided a chane of scenery was the way to go and since &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static blog generator was one of the most popular
Python-based solutions, I thought it was a nice choice.  After reading many,
many articles about which static site generator to use (some articles listed
50+ options), it&amp;#8217;s any wonder anyone can make any sort of informed decision.
The reason behind mine is that popularity is a good thing - something that
keeps bug fixes and features rolling in for time to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days here and there over the last few months, I&amp;#8217;ve been slowly improving
Pelican to suit my requirements and it&amp;#8217;s shaping up well.  The good news for everyone
else is that all my fixes have been merged into the main code base &amp;#8212; including
some Wordpress importer improvements and other fixes.  So far, it&amp;#8217;s doing everything
I need it to, although there&amp;#8217;s still some more things I&amp;#8217;d like to investigate&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; file as part of an existing theme.  So far it seems
1 theme == 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; file, but I could be&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; in the default theme.  Some things just look plain&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending existing themes or just being able to use a theme but override one
or two bits (eg one template).  I&amp;#8217;m unsure if this can happen&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="and-now"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And&amp;nbsp;now&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new site.  Apologies for some of the really old and outdated
content around.  Some people still access those links so presumably someone&amp;#8217;s
getting some use out of it.  During the import, it was funny to see how much
things (and I) have changed in the last few years.  So, sorry in advance for
the lack of post content from several years ago.  Maybe it&amp;#8217;ll prove fun to read
in years to come for&amp;nbsp;someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="issues"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Issues?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is open-source!  Report issues you see at
