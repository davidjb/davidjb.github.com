managed to migrate most of the content from my previous blog over at
Wikidot (which wasn't really a blog so much as it was a hacked wiki).
So, you'll find a lot more content here than before, which is good,
because it makes me look like I'm actually dedicated to creating content
;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also relaxed restrictions on comments (and added CAPTCHA security)
so comment away people, if you're reading this.&amp;nbsp; Just don't expect much
love if you spam though...&lt;/p&gt;

My aim is to
use this site now and slowly (but surely!) move away from the old haunts
of Wikidot. It's especially intelligent considering that I'm actually
paying for webspace on a yearly basis (albeit not much money) but I
figure I should be using it all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado - I declare my new site open for business. Much
like Queensland Transport and the local city council around here, the
road is under construction. So, please don't blame me (to my face ;) )
for any potholes you might hit.&amp;nbsp; It's a work in progress, so bear with
me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of fun, games, pain, and Plone are to come.&amp;nbsp; Seems almost ironic
I'm using WordPress as my CMS whilst I spout the joys (et cetera) of
Plone all the time.&amp;nbsp; For all those people who are curious (oh, there's
plenty I'm sure...): my shared webhost here doesn't offer Python, and
I'm not paying for a dedicated server.&amp;nbsp; Short and simple; it's about the
money (when is it not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
