features (how awesome does the start up and login screen look now?) and
also plenty of opportunities for things to break when I&amp;#8217;ve become so
accustomed to having them working. &amp;nbsp;At least it&amp;#8217;s not Windows though &amp;#8212;
I think I may just gnaw my own limbs off before I have to get forced to
upgrade to Windows 7 for gaming&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress, there was one reasonably small problem with the upgrade
that I saw on both of my Ubuntu machines (laptop and desktop):
&amp;nbsp;python-wxversion has a problem and won&amp;#8217;t upgrade. &amp;nbsp;Looking back in the
terminal it appeared that either it was an &amp;#8220;IOError: bad file
descriptor&amp;#8221; or otherwise a certain file (well, it did change when I
tried to reinstall) like wxversion.py can&amp;#8217;t be found in
/usr/lib/python2.6. &amp;nbsp;All very&amp;nbsp;confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was especially worrying when the installer came up and said &amp;#8220;Sorry,
your upgrade failed. &amp;nbsp;Your system could be in an unstable state.&amp;#8221; &amp;nbsp;That
sent alarm bells ringing and possibly with good reason (eg broken apps)
&amp;#8212; at least I had good reason to fix the problem rather than just ignore&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was simple for both&amp;nbsp;machines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
sudo apt-get remove python-wxgtk2.8
sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not painful at all. &amp;nbsp;Except it was a case of finding which package to
reinstall. &amp;nbsp;Don&amp;#8217;t try and reinstall python-wxversion like I did because
you won&amp;#8217;t get far. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#8217;ll still die. &amp;nbsp;python-wxversion is, however, a
dependency of the above package so all&amp;#8217;s well once you get that&amp;nbsp;sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Googling, it looks like this problem was common and thankfully
fixed in the repos. &amp;nbsp;Although, it was still present on Karmic upgrade so
who&amp;nbsp;knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s bad Karma? &amp;nbsp;I bet 1000 people have made that joke&amp;nbsp;already&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
