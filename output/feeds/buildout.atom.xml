just 1 misplaced line of a buildout configuration (and presumably
something that's changed somewhere else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-result"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much hunting and hunting, it turns out my Zope2 Fake Eggs weren't
being generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my long quest I had to go through downloading new packages and trying
to find something that had changed and even trying to establish new
virtual environments on different VMs.&amp;nbsp; Nothing would fix the problem.
To rub salt in the wound, my desktop Ubuntu ran the buildout fine, so
methinks the underlying reason for the pain is something OS-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many hours of debugging buildout output and trying to go through
the packages that seemed to be the cause (poor things, they were merely
bystanders, asking for dependencies), a few carefully-placed print
messages in the plone.recipe.zope2install package helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-cause"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh? what do you mean the install() function isn't being run?&amp;quot;, I found
myself saying after the print messages showed what was happening.&amp;nbsp; The
fake eggs didn't exist because the Zope2 recipe, whilst being initiated,
hadn't yet actually been run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thanks to the 'zope2' entry in the parts section of my buildout
being run after a whole lot of other sections, the other products never
had a chance.&amp;nbsp; Result: lesson learned -- put the zope2 section first,
and order matters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough though, it's never caused trouble before and obviously
there's a difference between Centos and Ubuntu.&amp;nbsp; Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
