just 1 misplaced line of a buildout configuration (and presumably
something that&amp;#8217;s changed somewhere&amp;nbsp;else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-result"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much hunting and hunting, it turns out my Zope2 Fake Eggs weren&amp;#8217;t
being&amp;nbsp;generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my long quest I had to go through downloading new packages and trying
to find something that had changed and even trying to establish new
virtual environments on different VMs.&amp;nbsp; Nothing would fix the problem.
To rub salt in the wound, my desktop Ubuntu ran the buildout fine, so
methinks the underlying reason for the pain is something&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many hours of debugging buildout output and trying to go through
the packages that seemed to be the cause (poor things, they were merely
bystanders, asking for dependencies), a few carefully-placed print
messages in the plone.recipe.zope2install package&amp;nbsp;helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-cause"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Oh? what do you mean the install() function isn&amp;#8217;t being run?&amp;#8221;, I found
myself saying after the print messages showed what was happening.&amp;nbsp; The
fake eggs didn&amp;#8217;t exist because the Zope2 recipe, whilst being initiated,
hadn&amp;#8217;t yet actually been&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thanks to the &amp;#8216;zope2&amp;#8217; entry in the parts section of my buildout
being run after a whole lot of other sections, the other products never
had a chance.&amp;nbsp; Result: lesson learned &amp;#8212; put the zope2 section first,
and order&amp;nbsp;matters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough though, it&amp;#8217;s never caused trouble before and obviously
there&amp;#8217;s a difference between Centos and Ubuntu.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
