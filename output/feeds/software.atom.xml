just made the startling discovery that VLC 1.0.0 has now been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using VLC since (before, actually) I thought there had to more
to playing videos than needing extravagent codec packs like K-lite or
anything similar to be installed on your system.&amp;nbsp; It's been that long
that the first version I used, if I remember correctly, wasn't actually
being specifically used for client-side file playback and was supposed
to be geared towards video streaming over a network.&amp;nbsp; My memory may well
be wrong on that one, so don't quote me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, VLC has matured in leaps and bounds across the versions,
much to the credit of all the developers working on it.&amp;nbsp; And this
version - above any others so far - is truly marvelous.&amp;nbsp; It's not too
often you see software that does everything you thought you needed - and
things you didn't.&amp;nbsp; I'll space you the mumbo-jumbo here, but if you
haven't seen it already, the change log is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/browser/NEWS"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The features/updates I'd been waiting for were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixing up DivX/XviD playback - and stopping me having to play/pause
cycle a video to get it to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global hotkeys - finally!&amp;nbsp; No more messing with GhostScript to get
VLC to play if it's not in focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remembering past files and the location in the Open File dialog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frame-by-frame playback - for finding those random stills in videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compressed file playback - seems like RAR files playback (and
apparently Zip too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live recording - slicing out bits of videos with a single click&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DVB playback for TV - looks good, haven't tested it yet though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjustable toolbars - yay!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list goes on..but it ticks all the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy first birthday VLC; here's to version 2 and onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
